    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "“Visit with Us” has recently introduced a **Wellness Tourism Package** to expand its service offerings. However, identifying customers who are most likely to purchase this package remains a significant challenge. The existing manual approach for customer identification is time-consuming, inconsistent, and highly dependent on individual judgment, which can lead to inefficient targeting and missed business opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a customer will purchase the Wellness Tourism Package before initiating sales outreach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Context\n",
    "\n",
    "“Visit with Us” is a leading travel and tourism organization that leverages customer data to enhance marketing effectiveness and customer engagement. With increasing competition and a diverse customer base, the company aims to adopt data-driven decision-making to improve conversion rates and optimize marketing efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "By predicting customer purchase intent in advance, the organization can:\n",
    "- Prioritize high-probability customers for sales outreach  \n",
    "- Improve campaign efficiency and customer satisfaction  \n",
    "- Reduce operational costs associated with ineffective targeting  \n",
    "\n",
    "To support this initiative, an **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** is implemented to automate data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices using GitHub Actions ensure scalability, consistency, and timely model updates.\n",

    "- **CityTier**: City category based on development level  \n",
    "- **OwnCar**: Indicates whether the customer owns a car  \n",
    "- **Passport**: Indicates whether the customer holds a valid passport  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Customer Interaction Attributes\n",
    "- **TypeofContact**: Mode of contact (Company Invited or Self Inquiry)  \n",
    "- **ProductPitched**: Type of tourism product pitched to the customer  \n",
    "- **PitchSatisfactionScore**: Customer’s satisfaction score for the sales pitch  \n",
    "- **NumberOfFollowups**: Number of follow-ups made after the pitch  \n",
    "- **DurationOfPitch**: Duration of the sales pitch  \n",
    "- **PreferredPropertyStar**: Preferred hotel rating  \n",
    "- **NumberOfTrips**: Average number of trips taken annually  \n",
    "- **NumberOfPersonVisiting**: Total number of people traveling with the customer  \n",
    "- **NumberOfChildrenVisiting**: Number of children below age five accompanying the customer  \n",
